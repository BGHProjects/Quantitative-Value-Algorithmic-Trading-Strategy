## Overview

- This repository is the result of following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzGZB4HhEE) from Freecodecamp regarding examples of algorithmic trading
- The purpose of following this tutorial was to strengthen my Pandas and Python skills, for future machine learning applications, by applyting them into an area which I have nascent knowledge but a keen interest in, which is algorithmic trading
- The content of this repository involves producing an investment portfolio based on the 50 stocks with the highest [quantitative value](https://alphaarchitect.com/2014/10/the-quantitative-value-investing-philosophy/)
- The datasets used in this implementation are not included in this repository
